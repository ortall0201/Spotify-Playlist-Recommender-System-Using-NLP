# ðŸŽµ Spotify Playlist Recommender System Using NLP

**Overview**
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to develop a personalized playlist recommender system. By analyzing playlist data from Spotify, the system identifies contextual relationships between songs and generates tailored recommendations based on user preferences.

## Features

- Artist-Based Recommendations: Focuses on artist similarity using fuzzy matching techniques to handle inconsistencies in naming conventions.
- Word2Vec Embeddings: Generates song embeddings to represent relationships within playlists.
- Hard Negative Sampling: Enhances model training by focusing on challenging negative examples.
- Evaluation Metrics: Includes Precision@K, Recall@K, and Mean Average Precision (MAP) to assess performance.
- Cosine Similarity: Used to compute the similarity between song embeddings for accurate recommendations.
- Cleaning and preprocessing of Spotify playlist data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and special characters.
- Visualization of key insights, such as top artists, track distributions, and playlist diversity.

## Dataset

Name of the dataset: Spotify Playlists-
Type of the dataset: 1.2GB of tabular data for music recommendation

The project uses the Spotify Playlists Dataset, which includes detailed information on user-generated playlists, artists, tracks, and more. This dataset is processed and analyzed in compliance with its terms of use.

You have 2 options: 
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/spotify-playlists/data?select=spotify_dataset.csv
2. Use direct public links to the dataset in the project, without downloading.
